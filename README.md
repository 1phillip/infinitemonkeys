# infinitemonkeys
This program attempts to simulates the "infinite monkey theorem."
From Wikipedia: The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

This program will repeatedly generate a random string of characters (length specified by user) and search for that string of characters within a passage. In this case, the passage is Shakespeare's Hamlet. The program first creates a pool of every possible character (letters, numbers, punctuation marks, etc.) in the passage. Then the program draws from this pool of possible characters to generate the random string. As a result, the passage can be changed to any language.
